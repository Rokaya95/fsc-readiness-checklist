# fsc-readiness-checklist
A self-assessment tool based on FSC Principles for evaluating forest certification readiness.
# FSC Readiness Checklist – Self-Assessment Tool

This project is a simplified simulation of a real **FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)** certification readiness assessment. It uses the official **10 FSC Principles** as a framework to evaluate a forestry company’s compliance, planning, and documentation.

## 📄 Included File

- `FSC Readiness Checklist.xlsx`  
  → Contains criteria, status tracking, evidence, and actions for each FSC Principle.

## Key Features

- Aligned with FSC Principles (2020)  
- Simple “Yes/In Progress/No” status tracking  
- Evidence documentation section  
- Action plan suggestions for gaps  
- Can be adapted to real forest operations

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- How FSC certification audits are structured  
- How to translate sustainability standards into measurable criteria  
- How to document audit readiness in Excel  
- How to identify gaps and build action plans

## Next Step

I plan to expand this checklist for **PEFC** and include **audit scoring logic** and **gap % analytics** in a future version.
